## About the game: 
### This game is similar to the older pokemon red and blue games for the NES, The main reason for choosing Pokemon was that was the first thing that came to my mind after the 2d RPG tutorial. This is a 2d Tile based movement game with a battle system which pops up when youre in battle mode. I used various tutorials from youtube and answers from stackoverflow to finish up most of the game. 
### The game also uses sword fighting mechenics to battle some in world enemies and combines battles with pokemons as well as regualar enemies
### Comments can be found in most of the code files, especially the ones i learnt from youtube to explain the thinking behind this. 
### Overall the entire project was fun and allowed me to work on my creativity more, coding was the part where I learnt a lot of C# and actual use of certain design patterns to solve some issues. The use of certain math functions was challening and learning about events was cherry on top.  
### Animations and making the inventory was the most fun.
### Making the battle system was the hardest part. 


### Pickups: 
#### 1. Pokeballs to hold your pokemons, the more you have the more you can hold onto 
#### 2. Coins: Collect them all to finish the level with most coins 
#### 3. Gold: To buy more powerups and pokemon from the shop

### Enemy Types: 
#### Pokemons in the wild: Fight them to add them to your collection. 
#### Trainers: Fight them to gain xp.
#### NPCs: Fight them to win money, or talk to them for interactive stories, or listen to their tales
#### Enemies groups: Fight them with your swords and try to survive.

### How to play:
#### The gameplay at the moment is pretty basic, we have battle system to deal with pokemon battles and regualar enemies who will destroy you on touch, main objective is to get the most amount of coins and and get to the end. 


#### Controls: 
#### Use Z for any selection on the battle screen. 

### Level 1: Tutorial to get you started, walk over to the grass to interact with  
### Level 2: Walk over to the NPC's to get clues, make sure the log doesnt hit you. 
### Level 3: Fight the two enemies and finally battle the main pokemon in a pokemon fight, chances of a pokemon fight are low but not 0.

### Current Bugs and Fixes to be implemented: 
#### The current model of the game is under development, further enhancements will be done over the summer, Main ones are as follows: 
#### 1. On hitting the enemy log the dialog box doesnt pop up since the enemy is a prefab, need to implement a fix for that. 
#### 2. We cannot change the enemy unit or randomize it for the wild battles or change our units. 
#### 3. A full fledged inventory system is needed to make sure you have potions, health, and more pokemon to use during battle. 
#### 4. More enemy types and futhering the AI to wander between 2 points of the map would also be needed. 
#### 5. SFX sounds and animations for the battle screen.
